Rather than requesting we delete all of your personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of your personal data to specific purposes. You may wish to request we restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your personal data and we are working to verify this information, or if you want us to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but cease processing it.Data Portability: You have the right to obtain copies of your information in a structured, commonly used format that you can move your data between our service and the services of others. We may request more information to confirm your identity before providing any personal data.Right to Object: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes or when our processing of your data is based on legitimate interests. You may request that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This is an absolute right and we cannot refuse this request. Beyond direct marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular situation. Even after receiving such a request, we may continue processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing.If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the request. If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies. If we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.</p> </div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="text-center foot-row"><a class="link" href="about-us.html">About us</a><a class="link" href="copyright-infringement-notice-procedure.html">Copyright infringement notice procedure</a><a class="link" href="contact-us.html">Contact us</a><a class="link" href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy policy</a><a class="link" href="term-of-use.html">Term of use</a></div><div class="text-center">@2021 Copyright https://drift-hunters.com</div></div></div></footer><div class="layer-loading hidden"><div class="loading_page"><img class="loadingImage" width="44" height="44" src="themes/drifthunters/rs/imgs/uk-page-loading.gif" /></div></div><script data-cfasync="false" src="cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script><script src="../code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="themes/drifthunters/rs/js/jquery.validate.min.js"></script><script src="themes/drifthunters/rs/js/cookie.js"></script><script src="themes/drifthunters/rs/js/footer.js"></script></body>
